Predicting chronic respiratory diseases using socio-environmental factors and geographic data part B


You're right, I apologize for that inaccuracy. I'll remove that statement and translate the rest to English. Here's the corrected and translated version:

## Semester B: Advanced Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling

In the second semester of the project, we deepened our research into chronic respiratory diseases, focusing on three main areas:

### 1. Data Cleaning and Refinement
We conducted a comprehensive and meticulous data cleaning process to ensure the quality and reliability of the information:
- Identification and treatment of missing values: We developed algorithms to identify missing data and complete it using advanced statistical methods.
- Detection and filtering of outliers: We implemented techniques to identify anomalous observations and established criteria for handling them.
- Standardization of variables: We unified the formats and units of various variables to allow for proper comparison and cross-referencing of data.
- Consistency checks: We conducted extensive checks to ensure consistency between different data sources.

### 2. Building an Advanced Data Pipeline
We developed a flexible and powerful data pipeline system:
- Combination creation: The system is capable of automatically creating a wide range of data combinations, incorporating various variables and diverse time periods.
- Modularity: We designed the pipeline in a modular fashion, allowing for easy addition or replacement of components as needed.
- Optimization: We implemented optimization mechanisms to improve processing performance, including advanced techniques for task distribution and parallel processing.
- Automatic documentation: The pipeline generates detailed documentation of each stage in the process, allowing for precise replication of results and quality control.

### 3. Running Predictive Models
We implemented and ran several advanced models for analysis and prediction:
- Linear Regression: Used as a baseline for comparison and identification of linear relationships between variables. We also conducted tests for the basic assumptions of regression and addressed any violations.
- Random Forests: We implemented this model to identify complex and non-linear patterns. We performed hyperparameter optimization and analyzed variable importance.
- XGBoost: We used this model to improve prediction accuracy and handle complex interactions between variables. We performed fine-tuning of parameters and analyzed the impact of variables on the results.

Using our developed pipeline, we created and analyzed multiple data panels. For each panel, we ran the three models with a wide range of settings. This process allowed us to:
- Identify the combinations leading to the most accurate prediction results for asthma and COPD.
- Examine the influence of various environmental and social variables on disease prevalence.
- Identify geographic areas at high risk for chronic respiratory diseases.

Additionally, we developed custom performance metrics to evaluate the models, weighing not only prediction accuracy but also the ability to explain the results and their clinical relevance.

This process not only significantly improved our understanding of the factors influencing the prevalence of chronic respiratory diseases but also provided us with powerful tools for analyzing complex data in public health. Our results provide important insights that can contribute to the development of more focused and effective health policies.
